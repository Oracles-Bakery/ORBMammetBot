## /emojiref

Shows a paginated, ephemeral embed listing all the bot's internal emojis and their names

**Usage:**
`/emojiref`

**Who can use:**
Oracle, Guildmaster, V

**Details:**

- Displays up to 40 emojis per page, with Next/Previous buttons
- Uses a slash command because it's required to make it ephemeral and otherwise it'd be huge
- Only the person who ran the command can use the paginator (ephemeral being those private replies a bot can do)
- Lists each emoji with its visual and name (`:emoji_name:`)
- Great for referencing emoji names for embeds or requesting them in a feature
