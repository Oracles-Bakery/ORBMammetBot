### _"Anything for the FC"_
</div>

This is the official repo for the Oracles Bakery Mammet, beloved son of Villicent and famously despised son of Villicent.<br/>
(It's a discord bot made to be always-free, with open and transparent code for the gang to all read through so they know they're safe, if you're looking for actual info)
---

## Quick Start

Looking to get the bot running for yourself? <br/>
Clone the repo and install dependencies, then it's ready to push to your (_totally_ made via V's referral link) [railway.com](https://github.com/sponsors/VAMProductions) environment!
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Oracles-Bakery/ORBMammetBot.git
cd ORBMammetBot
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Set up your .env file
python main.py
```
For help wiht your .env file you can check out [`settings.py`](settings.py) to see what environment pulls there are where you see `os.getenv()`.

# Feature Roadmap

Version numbers you see here are estimates, and are listed as X.Y.Z for `MAJOR.MINOR.FIX`<br/>
They'll be populated with numbers instead of letter when the order they'll be worked on is decided.<br/>
You can think of it like this:

`MAJOR` updates are things that REALLY expand the functionality, and I expect to be in version 1 for a long time, so I can make sure it all works. Version 2 will be when we break out of discord and have a website so people can use the bot with a prettier UI (So, you see, not any time soon.)<br/>
`MINOR` updates are new features, or, (hopefully never) the retirement of some features. A new channel for alerting you to free games is a nice feature, so it's a `MINOR` version update (because it's still all in the discord-bot only stage)<br/>
`FIX` updates are repairs and tweaks to things that already exist, and will more often than not be a group of updates all at once to make sure you're not getting updates spamming the merges. Current plan is to push all the fixes I have at 03:00 (that's 3am for you 12 hour enjoyers) UTC (server time for EU) every Monday (or "Sunday night" if you're so inclined.)
